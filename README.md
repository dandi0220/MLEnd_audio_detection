# The MiLe End Hums and Whistles Machine Learning Classification Mini-Project 

I have built a machine learning model to classify hum and whistles of 8 iconic songs (details of these eight songs as shown below). For example, take an input of a Potter audio segment of humming or whistling and predicts its song label (lables are these 8 types of songs)

* Harry Potter theme song (Potter) https://youtu.be/Htaj3o3JD8I?t=0
* The Imperial March (StarWars) https://youtu.be/s3SZ5sIMY6o?t=9
* Pink Panther theme song (Panther) https://youtu.be/lp6z3s1Gig0?t=10
* Singing in the rain (Rain) https://youtu.be/D1ZYhVpdXbQ?t=65
* Hakuna Matata (Hakuna) https://youtu.be/MBIWFTXQbi4?t=79
* Mamma Mia (Mamma) https://youtu.be/unfzfe8f9NI?t=50
* This is me (Showman) https://youtu.be/CjxugyZCfuw?t=115
* Let it go (Frozen) https://youtu.be/L0MK7qz13bU?t=126

# Dataset
As students of Queen Mary University of London, we have created approximately 15 seconds audio segments of these 8 songs.
